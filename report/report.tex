\begin{abstract}
This paper investigates a comprehensive approach to improve the effectiveness of visual search within large
image collections. The research focuses on evaluating the precision and recall of various image descriptors
and also analysing its impact on performance after dimensionality reduction.

The evaluation is conducted on the Microsoft MSRC V2 dataset, comprising 591 images across 20 categories. The study
delves into key feature extraction methods, including Global Color Histogram, Spacial Grid with Color and
Texture Histogram, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Evaluation metrics such as precision and recall are
employed to assess the performance of these techniques. The experiments reveal insights into the effectiveness of
different feature extraction methods for image retrieval.

Notable findings include how effective Convolutional Neural Networks are feature extraction, highlighting the
strengths and limitations of  each approach. The results contribute to the understanding of image retrieval
systems' performance, emphasizing their significance in diverse domains such as medical imaging, multimedia content
management, and e-commerce.

This research lays the groundwork for further exploration and optimization of content-based image retrieval
techniques, aiming to enhance the capabilities of systems that play a pivotal role in managing the ever-expanding
landscape of digital image data.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, this paper investigated several content-based image retrieval techniques such as Convolutional Neural
Networks, Spacial Grid with Color and Texture Histogram and Global Color Histogram. The evaluation metrics such as
precision-recall curves and confusion matrices, provided useful insights into the performance of various descriptors and
distance functions.

The results suggests that Convolutional Neural Networks offer substantially good results compared the Global Color
Histogram and Spacial Grid. However, there are many other approaches left to explore.

Because of their adaptability, content-based image retrieval systems are useful tools for a variety of industries,
including e-commerce, multimedia content management, and medical imaging. They provide effective ways to handle large
amounts of digital picture data.
